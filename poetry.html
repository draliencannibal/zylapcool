                He traces the lines in his hands,<br>
                the ones his father clenched in rage,<br>
                the ones his mother pointed with blame.<br>
                Flesh remembers what the mind would rather forget.<br><br>
                
                His father lived at the bottom of a bottle,<br>
                drowning while the world burned behind him.<br>
                His mother fed the flames,<br>
                denying the smoke curling from her tongue.<br><br>
                
                They danced their war in shattered glass and silence,<br>
                a duet of bruises and bitter words.<br>
                And he, he was the audience,<br>
                watching, learning, becoming.<br><br>
                
                Now love stands before him,<br>
                soft hands reaching, warm eyes pleading,<br>
                but he flinches at the touch,<br>
                hears his father’s anger in his breath,<br>
                his mother’s poison in his words.<br><br>
                
                How can he hold without hurting?<br>
                How can he love without war?<br>
                They never deserved this<br>
                so why should he?<br><br>
                
                So he steps back,<br>
                fingers curling into fists he never throws,<br>
                words dying on a tongue that will not lie.<br>
                Because love should not taste like blood.<br>
                Because love should not feel like home.<br>

                for my life was a performance, a scripted lie,<br>

                in petals grace, i wonder why. <br>
                life's vibrant hues, so vast and wide, <br>

                in beauty's mask, i try to hide, <br>
                a secret fear, i can't abide. <br>
                to live's a dance, to death, we glide, <br>
                in both i seek what's locked inside. <br><br>
                
                like petals trembling, kissed by night, <br>
                i fear the day's relentless light, <br>
                yet in the dark, shadows ignite, <br>
                the bloom of fears, their hidden flight.<br><br>

                i seek a haven from the world outside. <br><br>
                
                each bloom conceals a story untold, <br>
                in whispered hues of red and gold. <br>
                yet, in their beauty, i find no peace, <br>
                only a fleeting, fragile release. <br><br>
                
                like a wilting rose, i long to part, <br>

                in the silent garden, where dreams take flight, <br>

                in the back of my mind, where echoes resound,<br>

                the questions remain, but no answers in sight,<br>

                in the silence of this empty room, i dwell, <br>

                in this solitude, i grapple with my fears, <br>
                tears of uncertainty, i've cried countless years. <br><br>
                
                could it be that i'm the root of all my strife? <br>
